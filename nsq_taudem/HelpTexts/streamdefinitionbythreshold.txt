<p>Operates on any grid and outputs an indicator (1,0) grid identifing cells with input values &gt;= the threshold value. The standard use is to use an accumulated source area grid to as the input grid to generate a stream raster grid as the output. If you use the optional input mask grid, it limits the domain being evaluated to cells with mask values &gt;= 0 . When you use a D-infinity contributing area grid (*sca) as the mask grid, it functions as an edge contamination mask. The threshold logic is: src = ((ssa &gt;= thresh) &amp; (mask &gt;=0)) ? 1:0 .</p>
