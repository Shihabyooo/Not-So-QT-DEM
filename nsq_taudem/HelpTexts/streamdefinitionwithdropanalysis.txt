TEXT
<p>This tool combines the function of the "Stream Drop Analysis" tool and the "Stream Definition by Threshold" tool. It applies a series of thresholds (determined from the input parameters) to the input accumulated stream source grid (*ssa) grid and outputs the results in the stream drop statistics table (*drp.txt). Then it outputs a stream raster grid, which is an indicator (1,0) grid of stream cells. Stream cells are defined as those cells where the accumulated stream source value is &gt;= the optimal threshold as determined from the stream drop statistics. There is an option to include a mask input to replicate the functionality for using the *sca file as an edge contamination mask. The threshold logic should be: src = ((ssa &gt;= thresh) &amp; (mask &gt;=0)) ? 1:0</p>
