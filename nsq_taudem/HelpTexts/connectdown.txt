A OGR file is created.Using flow directions each outlet is moved downflow a specified number of grid cells which is user controllable (Default is 1). The ID of the location the point has moved to is taken as iddown. Two OGR files are created one with the initial points and one with the moved points. Both contain id, iddown and AreaD8. </p>
