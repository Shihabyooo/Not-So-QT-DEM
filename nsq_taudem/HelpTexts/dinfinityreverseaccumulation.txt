TEXT
<p>This works in a similar way to evaluation of weighted Contributing area, except that the accumulation is by propagating the weight loadings upslope along the reverse of the flow directions to accumulate the quantity of weight loading downslope from each grid cell. The function also reports the maximum value of the weight loading downslope from each grid cell in the Maximum Downslope grid.</p>
