TEXT
<p>Evaluates the extreme (either maximum or minimum) upslope value from an input grid based on the D8 flow model. This is intended initially for use in stream raster generation to identify a threshold of the slope times area product that results in an optimum (according to drop analysis) stream network.</p><p>If the optional outlet point shapefile is used, only the outlet cells and the cells upslope (by the D8 flow model) of them are in the domain to be evaluated.</p><p>By default, the tool checks for edge contamination. This is defined as the possibility that a result may be underestimated due to grid cells outside of the domain not being counted. This occurs when drainage is inwards from the boundaries or areas with no data values for elevation. The algorithm recognizes this and reports "no data" for the result for these grid cells. It is common to see streaks of "no data" values extending inwards from boundaries along flow paths that enter the domain at a boundary. This is the desired effect and indicates that the result for these grid cells is unknown due to it being dependent on terrain outside of the domain of data available. Edge contamination checking may be turned off in cases where you know this is not an issue or want to ignore these problems, if for example, the DEM has been clipped along a watershed outline.</p>
