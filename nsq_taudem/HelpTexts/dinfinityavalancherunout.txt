TEXT
<p>Identifies an avalanche's affected area and the flow path length to each cell in that affacted area. All cells downslope from each source area cell, up to the point where the slope from the source to the affected area is less than a threshold angle called the Alpha Angle can be in the affected area. This tool uses the D-infinity multiple flow direction method for determining flow direction. This will likely cause very small amounts of flow to be dispersed to some downslope cells that might overstate the affected area, so a threshold proportion can be set to avoid this excess dispersion. The flow path length is the distance from the cell in question to the source cell that has the highest angle.</p><p>All points downslope from the source area are potentially in the affected area, but not beyond a point where the slope from the source to the affected area is less than a threshold angle called the Alpha Angle.</p>
