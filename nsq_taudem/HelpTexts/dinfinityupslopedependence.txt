<p>The D-Infinity Upslope Dependence tool quantifies the amount each grid cell in the domain contributes to a destination set of grid cells. D-Infinity flow directions proportion flow from each grid cell between multiple downslope grid cells. Following this flow field downslope the amount of flow originating at each grid cell that reaches the destination zone is defined. Upslope influence is evaluated using a downslope recursion, examining grid cells downslope from each grid cell, so that the map produced identifies the area upslope where flow through the destination zone originates, or the area it depends on, for its flow.</p>
