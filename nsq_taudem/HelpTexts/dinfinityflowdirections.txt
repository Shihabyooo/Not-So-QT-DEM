<p>Assigns a flow direction based on the D-infinity flow method using the steepest slope of a triangular facet (Tarboton, 1997, "A New Method for the Determination of Flow Directions and Contributing Areas in Grid Digital Elevation Models," Water Resources Research, 33(2): 309-319). Flow direction is defined as steepest downward slope on planar triangular facets on a block centered grid. Flow direction is encoded as an angle in radians counter-clockwise from east as a continuous (floating point) quantity between 0 and 2 pi. The flow direction angle is determined as the direction of the steepest downward slope on the eight triangular facets formed in a 3 x 3 grid cell window centered on the grid cell of interest. The resulting flow in a grid is then usually interpreted as being proportioned between the two neighboring cells that define the triangular facet with the steepest downward slope.</p>
